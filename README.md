# Mini-Shell---A-Custom-UNIX-Shell-in-c
MiniShell is a lightweight, custom-built command-line shell written in C as part of my Operating Systems project. It replicates core features of a real shell, making command execution easier while also demonstrating process management, system calls, and I/O handling.
