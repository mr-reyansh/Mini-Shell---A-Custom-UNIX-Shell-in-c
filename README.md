# Mini-Shell---A-Custom-UNIX-Shell-in-c
MiniShell is a lightweight, custom-built command-line shell written in C as part of my Operating Systems project. It replicates core features of a real shell, making command execution easier while also demonstrating process management, system calls, and I/O handling.

✨ Key Features

🔹 Run basic commands (ls, pwd, echo hello)

🔹 Background execution (&) – run multiple processes at once

🔹 Input/Output Redirection (<, >, >>)

🔹 Piping (|) – chain multiple commands

🔹 Job Management (jobs, fg, kill)

🔹 Signal Handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z)

🎯 Why This Project?

- To understand how shells work internally

- To practice fork(), execvp(), waitpid(), dup2() system calls

- To showcase process scheduling and management concepts from OS

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C

- OS Concepts: Process Management, I/O Redirection, Inter-process Communication (IPC)

- Environment: Linux/Unix
